          <p>During my semester in Belfast, I couldn't miss the opportunity to climb Ireland's highest peak. The Devil's Ladder route lived up to its name - steep, loose scree that tested every bit of my scrambling skills. The weather was quintessentially Irish: four seasons in one day.</p>
          <p>What struck me most was the raw, rugged beauty of the Reeks. Standing at the summit cross, looking out over the lakes of Killarney with Atlantic storms rolling in from the west, I felt that familiar summit euphoria mixed with deep respect for these ancient mountains.</p>
          <p><strong>Route:</strong> Devil's Ladder (up), Heavenly Gates (down)<br>
          <strong>Conditions:</strong> Wet rock, strong winds at summit<br>
          <strong>Highlight:</strong> Meeting a local shepherd who's climbed it over 500 times!</p>

          <p>They say Monadnock is one of the most climbed mountains in the world, and on a beautiful summer day, I could see why. Started early to beat the crowds and catch the sunrise from the bare granite summit.</p>
          <p>The White Dot Trail offered a perfect mix of forest hiking and rock scrambling. The 360-degree views from the top stretched all the way to Boston's skyline on the clear morning. This peak perfectly captures what I love about New England hiking - accessible yet rewarding.</p>
          <p><strong>Route:</strong> White Dot Trail<br>
          <strong>Conditions:</strong> Perfect - clear and cool<br>
          <strong>Highlight:</strong> Watching hawks circle below the summit</p>

          <p>Mount Washington in May is still winter mountaineering. Started at 4 AM from Pinkham Notch with crampons and ice axe. The Tuckerman Ravine route is no joke - the headwall was still covered in snow and ice, requiring careful route finding.</p>
          <p>Above treeline, the notorious Mount Washington weather showed itself: 60mph winds and near-zero visibility. Navigation by cairns and compass. The summit was brutal - couldn't even stand upright. But those brief moments when the clouds parted revealed the entire Presidential Range in winter glory.</p>
          <p><strong>Route:</strong> Tuckerman Ravine Trail<br>
          <strong>Conditions:</strong> Full winter conditions, high winds<br>
          <strong>Highlight:</strong> Glissading down the ravine headwall!</p>

          <p>Don't let the low elevation fool you - Breakneck Ridge is one of the most fun scrambles on the East Coast. The initial climb is essentially rock climbing without ropes, gaining 400m in less than a mile.</p>
          <p>The exposed ridgeline offers incredible views of the Hudson River winding through the highlands. Watching the Metro-North trains look like toy models below never gets old. This has become my go-to training ground for building climbing confidence.</p>
          <p><strong>Route:</strong> Breakneck Ridge to Beacon Fire Tower loop<br>
          <strong>Conditions:</strong> Dry rock essential for safety<br>
          <strong>Highlight:</strong> The "flag pole" section - pure vertical scrambling</p>
