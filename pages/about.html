      <h2 class="section-title">My Journey</h2>
      <div class="text-content">
        <p>I'm Mark Yang, an Electrical and Computer Engineering student at Northeastern University with a deep passion for both technology and the outdoors. My journey into engineering began with a curiosity about how things work, which naturally evolved into building things that solve real problems.</p>
        
        <p>What sets me apart is my unique perspective that comes from rock climbing. The same methodical approach I use to solve a challenging boulder problem - breaking it down into sequences, finding the most efficient path, and persisting through failure - is exactly how I approach engineering challenges.</p>

          <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
          <p>Whether it's debugging code or finding the crux of a climbing route, I thrive on solving complex problems.</p>

          <h3>Continuous Learning</h3>
          <p>Technology evolves rapidly, and I'm always eager to learn new frameworks, languages, and paradigms.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">Beyond Code</h2>
      <div class="text-content">
        <p>When I'm not at my computer, you'll find me at the climbing gym or on trails. I've been climbing for 5 years and it's taught me invaluable lessons about persistence, calculated risk-taking, and the importance of community.</p>
        <p>I also enjoy photography, especially landscape and adventure photography, which allows me to combine my love for the outdoors with creative expression.</p>
